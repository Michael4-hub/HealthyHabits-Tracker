Welcome to my project. In it you can monitor your health by recording and viewing your healthy habits. 
What I learned: I learned a lot of thinks in code in the Python(e. g. how make it show today's date).
Sample log.json:  {
        1: "Drink water",
        2: "Sleep before 10 PM",
        3: "20+ min of exercise",
        4: "Ate fruits or veggies",
        5: "Read a book"
    }(habits you can register)
